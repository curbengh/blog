Ghostwriter is a Markdown editor with html preview. Previously I used [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/app), but it's web-based.

It has built-in US English spellcheck. It supports [Hunspell](https://hunspell.github.io/) dictionaries for other languages.

To install other languages is easy, for Danish:

```bash
$ sudo apt install hunspell-da
```

Substitute `apt` with your distro's package manager. In Ghostwriter, go to Settings > Preferences > Spell Check (tab), and select the desired language. You might need to toggle the spellcheck or switch the language back and forth for it to work.

Here is a list of Hunspell dictionaries in Ubuntu (18.04) repo:

**Edit (06/06/2019)**: Recently discovered [Inkdrop](https://inkdrop.app/) through [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20103589). It's a note-taking app that supports Markdown and can sync across devices. I think the best feature is its ability to sync the scrolling in editor and HTML output, which is absent in Ghostwriter. I only need a simple editor for my current use case, though I might consider it when I have >50 posts.

Reading through the HN comments, I also discovered [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) also supports Markdown and HTML preview. For a Markdown editor, it's probably overkill though.
