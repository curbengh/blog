TrueCrypt and KeePassX have been discontinued while Adblock Plus has been [commercialised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adblock_Plus#Controversy_over_ad_filtering_and_ad_whitelisting). Their replacements are [VeraCrypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr/), [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) and [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/) respectively.

Meanwhile, for server environment:

Software | Replacement | Comment
--- | ---
MySQL | [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)
ownCloud | [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/)
Apache/nginx | [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) | It's not a direct replacement, rather a web server that prioritise secure-by-default.
